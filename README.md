# loadash_stats
A simple program to get loadash stats

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Create .env file
2. Add the following entries in .env file
   GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://api.github.com'
   GITHUB_REPO = 'lodash/lodash'
   GITHUB_USERNAME = 'thepurplewanderer'
   GITHUB_TOKEN = '$your_token'
3. Run the python script charCount.py
   /usr/local/bin/python3.8 charCount.py (For example, on my local machine)

The final output will be printed on the screen. I have committed output.txt that shows the output from my last run.
